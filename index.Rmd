# Welcome

Welcome to the [**scMINER2**](https://github.com/jyyulab/scMINER2) tutorial!

**scMINER2** is our attempt to build a causal feature learning framework to untangle cell type resolved hidden gene regulatory network (hGRN) using information from gene expression and chromatin accessibility.

**scMINER2** performs gene expression and chromatin accessibility data integration in 3 steps.
a. Encoding RNA and ATAC network b. Reconstruction of bottleneck layer, a **Rewiring Matrix** c. Decoding the **Rewiring Matrix**. Through these series of analytical steps, **scMINER2** enables simultaneous inference of cellular differentiation trajectory and its underlying regulatory mechanisms and beyond. 

In this tutorial, we will provide detail workflow of single-cell chromatin accessibility data pre-processing using **ArchR** [package](https://github.com/GreenleafLab/ArchR) to help generate relevant inputs for the downstream **scMINER2** analysis followed by detail of **scMINER2** analysis workflow and concepts related to **scMINER2** framework.
